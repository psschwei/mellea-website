Small open-weight models keep getting better. A 3B Granite model on your
laptop today does things a 70B model couldn't do a year ago. There is still
a gap between "small model can technically do this" and "small model can
reliably do this on real data in production," and most teams cross that gap
by giving up and paying for a frontier reasoning model instead.

They shouldn't have to. The reason a small model fails on most production
tasks isn't raw capability; it's that the small model can't hold a
six-subtask problem in one shot. A frontier model given a thousand-token
system prompt with six subtasks inlined will muddle through. A 3B model
given the same prompt won't.

The fix is a better harness around the model you already have. By
"harness" we mean the software scaffolding around the model call:
decomposition, validation, retries, tool dispatch. The part that isn't
the forward pass. That's what Mellea is for.

## The Bet

Mellea is built around one observation: the software harness around a model
matters as much as the model itself. Frontier labs already know this. The
team training OpenAI's models knows exactly what the ChatGPT and Codex
harnesses look like, and that knowledge shapes the training data. The
open-weight ecosystem has mostly not had that feedback loop. You upload
weights to Hugging Face and people do whatever with them.

Mellea is the harness side of that co-design. It takes tasks that currently
demand a frontier model, breaks them into pieces a small model can do well,
and holds those pieces together with ordinary code rather than an
ever-growing English prompt.

Three things fall out of that approach:

- **Cost is predictable.** Local inference on a small model has a fixed,
  knowable cost per run, so you can back-test millions of runs without a
  finance conversation.
- **Data stays local.** Documents never leave the machine. For regulated
  domains like healthcare, finance, legal, and procurement, that's the
  difference between "can use this" and "can't."
- **The inference backend is yours to choose.** Mellea talks to Ollama,
  vLLM, Hugging Face, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so swapping
  backends is a one-line change. You aren't married to one provider's
  pricing or uptime.

## The Three Patterns

Mellea turns a task that needs a frontier model into one a small model can
handle through three moves:

![Decompose, externalize control flow, and modularize capabilities](/images/small-models-rock/three-steps.png)

1. **Decompose the task.** A single prompt bundles parsing, fuzzy matching,
   arithmetic, and generation. Split it into steps narrow enough that a
   small model can nail each one.
2. **Externalize control flow.** Keep the `for` loops, `if` statements, and
   retry logic in Python, not in the prompt. Models don't need to be
   instructed to iterate; code iterates.
3. **Modularize model capabilities.** Reuse validated components like
   structured output, typed generative functions, and RAG adapters
   instead of rebuilding them every time.

None of these is new. They are the ordinary software-engineering moves
you'd make for any non-trivial system. What's new is applying them to the
part of your program that happens to be written in English.

The argument in [*On the Foolishness of "Natural Language
Programming"*](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD667.html)
from 1978 applies directly:

> English is designed for communication between humans, not for
> specifying processes executed by machines. The fact that a modern
> model can *interpret* English well enough to try doesn't mean English
> is a good language to write your program in.

Drawing boundaries, stating contracts, decomposing work: that's where
the engineering has always lived. The syntax of the target language
was the trivial part.

## An Example Worth Walking Through

Pick a task that's just past what single-shot prompting can do reliably,
then build it up as a small-model pipeline.

A construction management firm wants to estimate material costs for a
project. The inputs are a construction plan (PDF, with a bill of materials
spread across several tables) and a handful of supplier catalogs (PDF,
DOCX, XLSX). The output is a priced HTML report with a pie chart breaking
spend down by category.

Ask a frontier model to do this in one shot and you can make it work. A
top-tier reasoning model with extended thinking gets most of the line
items right, cites the catalog it pulled the price from, and does it all
for about a dollar per run. Here's what one-shot prompting looks like
across the size spectrum:

| Model | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Small open-weight (<3B) | Doesn't understand the task. Returns a generic "cost breakdown" with no prices. |
| Open-weight reasoning (~20B) | Finds categories and subtotals. No pie chart. Numbers often wrong. |
| Gemini Fast | Mostly reasonable. No chart. Some prices off. |
| Frontier reasoning (GPT-5) | Gets most items right. Cites sources. No chart on first shot. ~$1/run. |

A dollar per run sounds cheap until you write down what the firm actually
wants to do with it. Fifteen hundred projects a year, twenty years of
history, a backlog of hypothetical backtests: *what if we'd switched lumber
suppliers in 2012? What happens to margins if this supply chain constraint
materializes?* One backtest is a Monte Carlo simulation over tens of
thousands of projects. At a dollar a run, that's the budget for a small
team.

Same task, as a local Mellea pipeline. Local models handle parsing,
validation, pricing, and chart/report generation instead of routing the
whole job through a frontier API. About a hundred lines of code. No API
keys, no egress, no per-token billing. Here's how.

```python
import mellea
from mellea.backends.model_ids import IBM_GRANITE_4_MICRO_3B

m = mellea.start_session(backend_name="ollama", model_id=IBM_GRANITE_4_MICRO_3B)
```

## Step 1: Parse the Construction Plan into a Bill of Materials

The construction plan is a PDF with tables scattered through it. Some are
bills of materials; others are schedules, notes, or summaries. The first
step is to get a clean, typed `BOM` object.

`RichDocument` wraps [docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) and
exposes tables as markdown, which small models handle much better than raw
HTML or PDF binary:

```python
from mellea.stdlib.components.docs.richdocument import RichDocument

plans = RichDocument.from_document_file("construction_docs/construction_plans.pdf")
```

To filter down to material-list tables, Mellea lets you declare a typed
generative function: a Python signature with no body, plus a docstring.

```python
from typing import Literal

@mellea.generative
def is_material_list(table_markdown: str) -> Literal["yes", "no"]:
    """Determines if the table contains a list of construction items."""
```

The `@mellea.generative` decorator turns the signature into a constrained
model call. The return type `Literal["yes", "no"]` forces a binary answer at
decode time. The model can't hedge with a paragraph, can't return "maybe,"
and can't return "probably yes." That constraint is enforced by the
sampler, not by a post-hoc prompt rule.

For tables that pass the filter, reformat them into a validated `BOM`:

```python
import pydantic

class BOMEntry(pydantic.BaseModel):
    item: str
    quantity: int | str
    notes: str
    category: Literal["lumber", "windows", "doors", "other"]

class BOM(pydantic.BaseModel):
    items: list[BOMEntry]
```

The schema pins the shape. But "quantity" has a construction-specific quirk:
alongside integers, entries can read *allowance* — meaning *buy some of these,
here's twenty bucks.* The Pydantic schema alone can't express that rule, so
it goes into a requirement with an explicit validator:

```python
from mellea.stdlib.requirements import req, simple_validate

def _quantity_ok(q) -> bool:
    return str(q).isdigit() or str(q).lower() == "allowance"

m.instruct(
    "Reformat this table to have four columns: item, quantity, category, and notes.",
    grounding_context={"table": table.to_markdown()},
    requirements=[
        req(
            "Quantity must be an integer or 'allowance'",
            validation_fn=simple_validate(
                lambda out: all(_quantity_ok(e.quantity) for e in BOM.model_validate_json(out).items)
            ),
        ),
    ],
    format=BOM,
)
```

Two layers of enforcement: `format=BOM` constrains the decoder to emit valid
JSON matching the schema; the `requirements` list adds business-logic checks
on top. If validation fails, Mellea re-samples. The loop is Python; the model
only has to do the reformatting.

### Parallelize across tables

Construction documents often carry many tables, and each table is
independent of the others. In the full notebook, this step fans out with
`ainstruct`: one coroutine per material-list table, then a gather that
merges the resulting `BOM` objects. Wall-clock scales with the slowest
table, not the sum. The loop shape stays in Python.

## Step 2: Load the Product Catalogs

Catalogs come in whatever format the supplier happened to send. `RichDocument`
handles PDF, DOCX, and XLSX the same way:

```python
from mellea.stdlib.components.docs import Document

def load(path: str) -> Document:
    return Document(text=RichDocument.from_document_file(path).to_markdown())

doors_doc = load("construction_docs/product_catalogs/door_product_catalog.pdf")
windows_doc = load("construction_docs/product_catalogs/north_ridge_windows.docx")
```

Each becomes a plain `Document`, the input format Mellea's RAG adapters
expect. Any item whose category isn't keyed into the catalog lookup below will
land in the report as "unknown."

## Step 3: Match BOM Entries to Prices with RAG Adapters

Matching "36x80 Aurora half-moon entry door" from a bill of materials to
the right line in a product catalog is fuzzy by nature. Rather than ask a
general-purpose model to "find the right price and tell me if you're sure,"
put a calibrated gate in front of extraction.

The adapters run on the HuggingFace backend, so start a second session:

```python
from mellea.backends.huggingface import LocalHFBackend
from mellea.stdlib.components.intrinsic.rag import check_answerability
from mellea.stdlib.context import ChatContext

m_hf = mellea.MelleaSession(backend=LocalHFBackend(model_id=IBM_GRANITE_4_MICRO_3B))
```

The one line that matters is `if verdict == "answerable":`. The loop walks
every BOM item, picks the right catalog by category, and asks the
answerability adapter whether a price is extractable before it ever asks the
model to produce one:

```python
CATALOGS = {"windows": windows_doc, "doors": doors_doc}

def price_one(entry: BOMEntry) -> tuple[float | None, float | None]:
    catalog = CATALOGS.get(entry.category)
    if catalog is None:
        return None, None  # no catalog for this category → unknown

    verdict = check_answerability(
        f"What is the price of {entry.item}?",
        documents=[catalog], context=ChatContext(), backend=m_hf.backend,
    )
    if verdict != "answerable":
        return None, None  # adapter isn't confident → unknown, not hallucinated

    unit = extract_unit_price(entry, catalog)          # m.instruct, format=...
    total = extract_total(unit, entry.quantity)        # m.instruct, format=...
    return unit, total
```

`verdict == "answerable"` is a gate: items the adapter can't confidently
answer don't get a hallucinated price, they get `total_price=None` and
flow through to the report as "unknown." Failure modes are explicit. And
the model is only ever asked to extract a number from a document where a
calibrated adapter has already confirmed the number is there. The hard
problem (*is this the right document at all?*) was solved by a
specialized adapter rather than by a general prompt.

What makes these adapters worth reaching for, as opposed to asking a
general model "is this document relevant, 1-10," is that the outputs are
**calibrated**. Pass the doors catalog and a doors question, you get a
high-confidence `"answerable"`. Pass the lumber catalog with the same doors
question, and answerability correctly collapses to `"unanswerable"`.
Frontier model logits don't give you this. Nothing in a general-purpose
model's training signal makes the raw next-token probabilities mean
"calibrated confidence that this document answers this question." Adapters
are trained to make them mean that.

The same adapter family also supports context relevance and citation
finding. Granite adapters ship as **[ALoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12397)**
adapters, so multiple checks on the same long document can reuse the base
model's prefill instead of paying for the full document pass each time. You
get modularity without paying 3× the compute.

## Step 4: Generate the Report

The final step is two instructions: make the chart, then write the report
around it.

Pricing runs on a 3B Granite model, but chart-drawing code is a different
beast. Tool-calling and matplotlib benefit from a model with more muscle,
so for this step switch sessions to GPT-OSS 20B running locally on Ollama.
The same `m` name now points at the larger model for the remainder of the
pipeline:

```python
from mellea.backends.model_ids import OPENAI_GPT_OSS_20B
from mellea.backends.model_options import ModelOption
from mellea.stdlib.tools import local_code_interpreter
from mellea.backends.tools import MelleaTool

m = mellea.start_session(backend_name="ollama", model_id=OPENAI_GPT_OSS_20B)
```

The chart step hands the model a tool and lets it drive:

```python
chart = m.instruct(
    "Use the code interpreter to create a pie chart of cost breakdowns "
    "by category. Save it to /tmp/chart.png.",
    grounding_context=report_ctx,  # {item: {total_price, category}} for each priced row
    tool_calls=True,
    model_options={ModelOption.TOOLS: [MelleaTool.from_callable(local_code_interpreter)]},
)
chart.tool_calls["local_code_interpreter"].call_func()
```

Then a plain instruct writes the HTML report around that image:

```python
report = m.instruct(
    "Write an HTML report with a top-line cost breakdown by category and a "
    "line-item material list with prices. At the top include /tmp/chart.png.",
    grounding_context=report_ctx,
)
```

Swapping sessions mid-pipeline is one line. Each step runs against the
model that suits it: tiny and cheap where the task is narrow, bigger only
where the task demands it.

The chart is drawn by actual Python code executing on actual data, not by a
diffusion model hallucinating a plot. The grounding context is a plain
dict, not a vector store. When the context is small and structured and
known at call time, passing it directly is simpler and more predictable
than dragging in retrieval.

Here's what the pipeline actually produces. The chart and top-line table:

![Construction material cost report with pie chart and category totals](/images/small-models-rock/chart1.png)

And the line-item list, where every row is either a price extracted from a
catalog or an explicit `unknown`:

![Line-item material list with per-row prices or unknown](/images/small-models-rock/chart2.png)

The grand total ($7,885.04) is the sum of *known* items only. Lumber items
the answerability adapter couldn't confidently price stay as `unknown`
rather than as fabricated numbers, and the lumber row in the top-line
table is annotated *excluding unknown items* so the gap is visible at a
glance. That's the property worth checking — not that every row gets a
price, but that unsupported rows fail loudly.

## Small Models, Frontier-Level Output

Step back from the construction example. The general shape of the trade:

<img src="/images/small-models-rock/harnessed.png" alt="A small model, harnessed" style="max-width: 60%;" />

A task that one-shot required a frontier model and a dollar per run now
runs as a local pipeline with smaller models doing the narrow parts. Pricing
extraction runs on Granite 4 Micro 3B via HuggingFace; chart and report
generation run on GPT-OSS 20B via Ollama. No API keys, no egress, no
per-token billing. Items the pipeline can't confidently price show up as
`unknown` in the output rather than as hallucinated numbers, so the report
is auditable instead of something a human has to re-check line by line.

The construction case isn't a one-off. The same three-pattern approach
generalizes. In internal evaluations on agent benchmarks the Mellea team
has run (a DB2 database agent and a compliance agent), rewriting large
prompt-based systems as Mellea programs produces meaningful task-completion
gains on large models and lets much smaller open-weight models approach
the accuracy of a baseline several tiers up. Those points of task
completion are the ones you usually can't buy without going up a model
tier. The harness buys them instead.

The win is not that one tiny model does everything. The win is that the
harness lets narrow steps run on tiny local models, reserves larger local
models for the few steps that need them, and keeps control flow, validation,
and failure handling in code. If you're paying frontier-model prices for a
task that decomposes cleanly, there's a good chance you're paying for
engineering you haven't done yet.

## Trade-offs

Latency per run is higher than a single API call. Async execution hides
most of the fan-out, but a pipeline will always be slower per-run than one
prompt. The win is in cost, privacy, and auditability, not in tail latency.

Rate limits disappear. A frontier API can rate-limit you mid-backtest;
local inference can't. When a pipeline fails at 3am, debugging a
decomposed Mellea program means finding *which step* went wrong — a single
frontier-model call is a black box. And the obvious alternative to
"better harness + small model" is "fine-tune a small model." Harnessing
is cheaper to iterate on and composes with fine-tuning later if you need
it.

Decomposition takes engineering effort. It's ordinary software work — a
senior engineer can typically port a prompt pipeline in a day or two, and
the GPU or laptop amortizes fast compared to even a week of frontier-API
backtests. It pays back once the task is recurring, privacy matters, or
cost compounds at scale.

Not everything decomposes. Tasks that are genuinely holistic, like
free-form creative writing or long-form reasoning chains that cannot be
separated into clean intermediate states, still favor a big model. Know
which kind of task you have before you invest.
