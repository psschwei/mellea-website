## Contributing

There are two distinct ways to contribute — pick the one that applies:

### Writing a blog post

No development environment needed. Copy [`templates/blog-post.md`](templates/blog-post.md) to
`content/blogs/your-slug.md`, fill in the front matter, and open a PR against `main`. A maintainer
will review and merge it — the post goes live automatically on merge.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full submission steps and front matter reference.

### Changing the site (UI, CI, dependencies)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:4000
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development guide — commands, testing, and CI pipeline.
